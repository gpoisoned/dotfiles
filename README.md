# dotfiles

New machine setup:
 - fork this repo, then clone your copy locally
 - find all instances of 'josh' and replace them as appropriate (as of last update to this readme, this should only be in .gitconfig)
 - check the dependencies list in each setup script before running it
 - run osx-setup.sh (if you're on another OS, I recommend reading through that script and figuring it out for yourself - sorry...)
 - run handshake-setup.sh if you work at Handshake
