# 12eh's dotfiles

This is nothing fancy, but it beats re-creating all of this manually

New machine setup:
 - fork this repo, then clone your copy locally
 - find all instances of 'josh' and replace them as appropriate (as of last update to this readme, this should only be in .gitconfig)
 - if you're a vim person, go ahead and replace my .vimrc with yours (scripts here assume you're using Vundle)
 - check the dependencies list in each setup script before running it
 - run osx-setup.sh (if you're on another OS, I recommend reading through that script and figuring it out for yourself - sorry...)
 - run handshake-setup.sh if you work at Handshake

Making modifications to preference files:
 - if you modified files on github or in your local dotfiles directory, run pull.sh
 - if you made modifications to the files in various other locations, run push.sh
